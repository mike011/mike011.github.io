Milestones for Swift was the ability to message your friends as you passed certain distances or times while riding the bike.

Originally I started this in November of 2018 while the project was completely in Objective-C. But there were some show stopping bugs and some other things came up so it was droppped. Recently in March of 2020 I picked up the feature again. But the code base had changed and all new code was being wrote in Swift.
