Another gem from Scott Adams about making yourself luckier. It is suggested you do what you can to move from situations with a low possibility to a higher possibilitity. Some things are obvious, like winning the lottery. The most straight forward strategy is to simply buy more tickets. This increases your odds, but only very slightly. A better strategy is why do you find a game that has better pay outs or less combinations. How about finding a game that doesn't really nearly 100% on chance?
